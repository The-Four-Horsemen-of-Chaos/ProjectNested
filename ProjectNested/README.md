# Project Nested

Our currently unnamed game starts with the player character in a dystopian society that has expended all of the available natural resources. Due to this necessity and the advanced technology of the time, the government sends you the player to go back in time to collect natural resources to return back "for the future" so that they can replenish their natural resources.
